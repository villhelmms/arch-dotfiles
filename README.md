# Arch Hyprland .dotfiles

My take on Arch .dotfiles (customization). These are ***Work in Progress** dotfiles so don't expect anything spectacular. I am not a programmer or a masive developer. I just want to try customize my Arch install.

> [!CAUTION]
> The install script is meant for a fresh Arch Linux install using 'archinstall' Hyprland profile. I cannot guarentee that this script will work for your system or existing Arch installs. Please go through and read the script before running it!

Custom configurations for the listed projects / packages:
- hyprland
- hyprpaper
- waybar
- rofi
- zsh / ohmyzsh
- kitty

Projects / packages yet to be customized:
- hyprlock (WIP)
- dolphin (still don't know if i'm going to stick with it)
- firefox
- libreoffice (I have no clue of this is possible, I'm just adding this here to remind myself to check it later)
